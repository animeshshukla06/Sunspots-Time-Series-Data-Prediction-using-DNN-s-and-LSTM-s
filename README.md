# Sunspots-Time-Series-Data-Prediction-using-DNN-s-and-LSTM-s
This notebook contains the technique of Deep Learning which predicts time series values using Deep Neural Networks(DNN's) and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM's) of the sunspots data which corresponds to the monthly mean values of black spots on sun which gets developed because of the large amount of heat getting trapped within the sun due to generation of a very strong complex magnetic field which does not allow the sun to radiate its heat and thus it traps a large amount of heat in sun and hence black spots are formed..
I have explained everything in brief in my blog , you can have a look at that.
